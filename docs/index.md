# The Seedling Project

This is an attempt at creating a web server project
for the benefit of Modesto Junior College
and the communities affected by it. It serves as a
hub of information for those motivated enough
to seek out opportunities beyond the immediate.
It serves as a resource of education that enriches
the classes and allows for those struggling to
have tailored help. Through this project, the seedlings
at this school hope to grow into towering trees.

The central idea differs from CommunityALI or the
MJC site because this site is more verbose
and focuses on a connection between the students
and the school. As such, a "bloggy" type of model
has been adapted into the formulation of the site.
It will also be actively maintained by students
and have minimal bloat and minimal bureaucratic approach.
