# Getting Started

## Maintainers

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine

- `git clone https://github.com/ImmaculateDivinity/SeedlingEducation`
- This uses HTTPS which may require a different format if `git clone` is
  configured with SSH

2. Create a feature/release/patch/fix branch depending on what you are trying to
   contribute and switch to that branch

3. Install dependencies (assuming proper installation of npm and pip, and a
   python virtual environment)

   - `npm install && pip install -r requirements.txt` - dev-build dependencies
   - `pre-commit install` - pre-commit hooks

4. Periodically update your branch

```bash
git checkout <branch_name> # switch to dev branch
git fetch origin           # update dev branch with main branch
git merge origin/main
```

## Outside Collaborators

1. Fork the repository onto your profile

2. Clone your fork onto your local machine

3. `git remote add  upstream https://github.com/ImmaculateDivinity/SeedlingEducation`

   to add a remote to main repository

   > Please keep your fork updated with the main repository before opening a
   > pull request [Always pull before push]

4. `git fetch upstream` to grab changes from the main repository. Alternatively,
   GitHub offers and option on the website to _Sync Fork_.

5. Create a feature/release/patch/fix branch depending on what you are trying to
   contribute and switch to that branch

6. Install dependencies (assuming proper installation of npm and pip, and a
   python virtual environment)

   - `npm install && pip install -r requirements.txt` - dev-build dependencies
   - `pre-commit install` - pre-commit hooks

7. Periodically update your fork's main branch
   > To keep development branch up to date with main, first make sure to have
   > your main branch on your fork up-to-date with upstream via #4 then

```bash
git checkout <branch_name> # switch to dev branch
git fetch origin           # update dev branch with main branch of fork
git merge origin/main
```
